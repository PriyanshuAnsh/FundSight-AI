- Real-time Market Comps: Integrate PitchBook, CB Insights, or public datasets
- Memory & Portfolio Tracking: Store multiple deals and track ongoing returns
- Email Parsing: Automate deal update ingestion from investor emails
- Mobile App: For on-the-go deal evaluation
- Multi-user Accounts: For syndicates or fund management

---

8. User Acquisition & Feedback Strategy

- Target angel investor communities on LinkedIn and AngelList
- Share in startup and VC forums (Reddit: r/startups, r/venturecapital)
- Offer free deal evaluation during beta phase
- Collect user feedback & iterate rapidly

---

9. Sample User Input & Output

Input:
- Business: "AI bookkeeping SaaS for freelancers"
- Market: Small-to-medium businesses
- Revenue model: $19/month subscription
